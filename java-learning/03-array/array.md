Variables can store only a single value (0:09).
If you have many values (e.g., 10, 100) and want to store them, creating a separate variable for each is inefficient and hard to manage (1:00).
An array allows you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable (1:24).
Arrays can be imagined as a "tray of cups" that can hold many items, making it easier to manage data (2:25).
When creating an array, you can either initialize it with values or specify its fixed size (3:02).
